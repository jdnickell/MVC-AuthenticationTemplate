# MVC-AuthenticationTemplate
Empty project with working Owin authentication.
A trimmed down boring version of the default MVC Project with Authentication. 

Create a database and then run SqlFiles/CreateAspNetUser.sql using the database name. 
Update the connection string to use that database name as well. 
Initially configured to use LocalDb.
